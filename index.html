<h3>It's a template engine…</h3>

<p>
…that grew from the desire to automate some of the repetitive tasks in
building web applications.
</p>

<pre>
Some example code is littered throughout this page.
You'll find it dressed up in pre-formatted
paragraphs such as this one.
</pre>

<p>
Managing your DOM is often a trade-off between writing lots of tiny views for
the smallest parts of your page, hooking up tons of event handlers to update
specific elements, or ‘throwing in the towel’ and just updating swaths of page
content at the cost of performance.
</p>

<p>Let's see if we can make this a bit easier.</p>


<h3>What sets it apart</h3>

<p>
Writing DOMJuice templates is not too much unlike writing templates in other
languages. What sets it apart is all the extras you get <em>after</em> you've
written them.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the highlights of what to expect:
</p>

<h4>Stored in the DOM</h4>
<p>
As opposed to e.g. text-based templating languages, DOMJuice operations are
all just special attributes on your elements. Operations are denoted using
the <code>:=</code> operator.
</p>

<pre>
&lt;div id:="domjuiceAttribute"
     class="regularAttribute"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img src:="url"&gt;
</pre>

<p>
DOMJuice will still happily take a string as input, but you could just as
well store a template as regular markup in your page, as done in the
<a href="test.html">test suite</a>, for example.
</p>

<h4>Logic-less templating</h4>
<p>
Inspired by <a href="http://mustache.github.com/">Mustache</a>. Instead of
embedding code in templates, with DOMJuice you build from sections and simple
content or attribute value replacements.
</p>

<pre>
&lt;div section:="friends"&gt;
  &lt;img src:="mugshot" alt:="name"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<h4>Updates automatically</h4>
<p>
DOMJuice has no dependencies, but provides a plugin interface to tie in
with other libraries. Out of the box, a
<a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone.js</a> plugin is
provided, which updates your views as you update your models and collections.
It's magic!
</p>

<pre>
&lt;h2 content:="tagline"&gt;
  I will be replaced by the value of `tagline`,
  and update automatically when it changes again!
&lt;/h2&gt;
</pre>

<h4>Animates automatically</h4>
<p>
Plugins can also provide animations. This works for content as well as
sections, to transition in and out items without a single line of code.
</p>

<pre>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li section:="items" fx:="slide"&gt;
    &lt;span content:="name"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;span content:="quantity"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
</pre>

<p>
A few simple <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> based effects are bundled,
such as the tagline fade effect you see above. But if these don't suit your
needs, writing custom animators is peanuts, really.
</p>


<h3>Early days!</h3>

<p>
DOMJuice is still in a very early stage of development. There's no official
release as of yet.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, feedback is very welcome. Feel free to send me a note on
GitHub, or open issues for any bugs or browser incompatibilites you may find.
